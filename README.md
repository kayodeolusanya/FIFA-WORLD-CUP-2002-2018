# FIFA-WORLD-CUP-2002-2018

The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an
international association football competition contested by the
senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global
governing body. The championship has been awarded every four
years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and
1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The
current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018
tournament in Russia.

The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national
teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have
played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are
Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and
inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and
Spain, with one title each.
